Developer Guide
===============

In this docuement, we share the rationale for the specific choices made
when designing the system. The first part of this document describes the
development environment and code quality assurance rules. Then, the second
part presents a brief description for the system modules and their connections.
Finally, the third part uses an example to walk through the system codebase
to illustrate how the system works.
